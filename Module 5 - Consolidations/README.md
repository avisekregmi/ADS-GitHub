# Module 5 - Consolidations

# Session Overview

In this session, I will be randomly assigned to a course colleague. Your colleague will discuss her/his notebook(s) from the Module 3 project with me. Following that, she/he will present her/his idea for a final CAS project. Next our roles will be switched.

## Article Discussion

We will discuss the article [Artificial Intelligence - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/).

## Group Activity: Google Slides Presentation

Each group will prepare a set of Google Slides summarizing the chapters assigned to the group from the Stanford article. Each summary can have a maximum of 10 slides. Groups will self-organize their division of work and presentation.

## Additional Article Discussion

We will also discuss the article [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Mathematical Modeling: A Systematic Review](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42979-021-00592-x.pdf).

### In-Class Article Discussion

Before class, everyone is expected to read the article and bring one question. In class, we will form 6 groups during the first 75 minutes, with each group discussing one question (about 15 minutes per question). Each group will bring one question to the second 75 minutes, where the questions will be further discussed.
