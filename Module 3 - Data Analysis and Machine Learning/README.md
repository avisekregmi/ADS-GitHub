# Module 3 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning

In this Module, I am exploring the basics of machine learning using Python.

## What I am Learning:

- I am getting an overview of machine learning pipelines and figuring out how to use them with scikit-learn.
- I am diving into Regression and Classification, understanding linear models and logistic regression.
- Exploring Decision trees & random forest models to make predictions.
- Understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and non-linear embeddings like t-SNE and UMAP.
- Learning about Clustering with K-means and Gaussian mixtures.
- Experimenting with Artificial Neural networks, using fully connected nets to classify the fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Checking out Scikit-learn and clustering maps.
