**Repository created by Avisek Regmi 2023/2024**

This repository consists of all Applied Data Science Modules taught by different academic professors and IT professionals in the field of Data Science at the University of Bern. There are a total of 6 Modules, and each Module has different materials that cover various topics in Data Science.

## Modules:

1. **Module 1 - Data Acquisition and Management**
2. **Module 2 - Statistical Inference for Data Science**
3. **Module 3 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning**
4. **Module 4 - Ethics and Best Practices**
5. **Module 5 - Consolidations**
6. **Module 6 - Deep Learning**

A final project will be done at the end of each Module to apply what I have learnt in an actual Data Science project.
