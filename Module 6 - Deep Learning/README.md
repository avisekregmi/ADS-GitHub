# Module 6 - Deep Learning

In this module we will learn about machine learning and practice building our own neural network.

## What's This All About

Because we now have more access to data and better computers, machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used in many different areas. They help with things like recognizing images, making decisions online, understanding languages, building robots, and much more.


## What We Will Learn

By the end of this Module, we will be able to:
- Understand the basics of neural networks and how they learn.
- Handle basic operations in TensorFlow and understand what a computational graph is.
- Solve problems related to optimization.
- Use TensorFlow to recognize digits with neural networks.
- Visualize how your machine learning is working using TensorBoard.
- Work with images and signals using deep convolutional networks.
- Apply TensorFlow to do machine learning with your own sets of data.
